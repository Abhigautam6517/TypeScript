How to remove duplucate error?

just write in export{} in ts file then they dont show error bcz app.ts file when convert in js file so they use use-strict mode.

if I change my code in ts file so we need everytime in tsc app.ts?

no , if you want your code is save and then automatically run it so you use watch
tsc app.ts --watch
